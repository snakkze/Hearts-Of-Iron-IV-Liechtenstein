  LIE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Liechtenstein is a small country in the heart of Europe that has been demilitarized for over 50 years. It is ruled by the noble family Liechtenstein and, similar to the old German Empire, operates as a constitutional monarchy.\n \nLike its neighbor Switzerland, Liechtenstein remained neutral during the Great War and, following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, strengthened its ties with Switzerland. The country adopted the Swiss Franc as its currency and signed defense pacts with the Swiss to ensure its protection."
  LIE_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Since the German Anschluss of Austria, the small nation of Liechtenstein has found itself in a precarious situation. The influence of Germany has been on the rise, and there have been attempts by the Nazi movement to overthrow the country. The question now is whether Liechtenstein can maintain its neutrality or if it will be forced to compromise its independence in order to preserve its sovereignty. §11936 recommended, 1939 is working but the focus is the historical, so its rather boring§!."
