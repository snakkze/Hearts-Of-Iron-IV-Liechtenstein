  lie_LIE.1.t:0 "Established Ties"
  lie_LIE.1.d:0 "Since we recognized our Habsburg heritage, we have been searching for potential Habsburg descendants whom we can install as the head of our small state to lay claim to territories that were once under Habsburg rule long ago. Finally, we have managed to establish ties with two Habsburgs, Otto von Habsburg and his sister, Archduchess Adelheid of Habsburg-Lorraine. If we can garner enough support for monarchy in our country, we plan to appoint the Archduchess of Habsburg-Lorraine as our head of state through a marriage arrangement. Subsequently, we aim to exert influence over a Habsburg-led Hungary under the rule of Otto von Habsburg, creating a puppet state."

  lie_LIE.2.t:0 "Cutted Swiss Ties"
  lie_LIE.2.d:0 "We had to open our eyes. Over the past 10 years, our economy has been slowing down ever since we adopted the Swiss franc as our currency.

  lie_LIE.5.t:0 "Liechtenstein offers Guarantee"
  lie_LIE.5.d:0 "After the recent events in the former Austro-Hungarian sphere, Liechtenstein has made an intriguing offer. They are willing to provide us with a guarantee of protection if we allow them to occupy our country and give up our independence. In return, we would become a part of their strong empire, which offers the promise of security and protection from potential German invasion. The decision lies before us, and we must carefully weigh the implications of this proposal for the future of our nation."

With careful planning and unwavering resolve, we shall seek revenge on the Kingdom of Bohemia for their defiance and assert our authority in the region."
